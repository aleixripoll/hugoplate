Truth and power can travel together only so far. Sooner or later they go their separate ways. If you want power at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power. You will have to admit things - for example about the sources of your own power - that will anger allies, dishearten followers or undermine social harmony. (...)

As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it - and even when we try to understand it, we usually do so in the hope that understanding the world will make it easier to control it. Therefore, if you dream of a society in which truth reigns supreme and myths are ignored, you have little to expect from Homo sapiens. Better try your luck with chimps.
