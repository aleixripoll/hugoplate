&mdash; Joel, I'm not a concept. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.

&mdash; You had the whole human race pegged.

&mdash; Probably.

&mdash; I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
