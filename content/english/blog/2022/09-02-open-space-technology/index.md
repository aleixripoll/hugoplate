Behavior at an Open Space gathering is guided by four principles and one law.

## THE FOUR PRINCIPLES
- Whoever comes is the right people.
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
- Whenever it starts is the right time.
- When it’s over, it’s over.

## The One Law
The one law is the **Law of Two Feet**, which says that *If, during our time together, you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet and go to some more productive place.*

(...) First, it is death to egotists, those who are sure that they alone possess the truth, and further, that it is their divine mission to impart it, regardless of anyone else’s feelings or desires. Such people rapidly get a new and sobering message when half the room applies the Law of Two Feet and leaves. Indeed, just knowing that all participants do have the option to walk usually is sufficient to keep the egotists in line.

The second major effect of the law is to place responsibility for the quality of each person’s learning and/or contribution directly where it belongs —with that person. In the final analysis, nobody can assume that responsibility for any other person, except in the case of very small children and seriously compromised individuals. All too often we sit politely, getting angrier and angrier, while our time is being wasted. The lost time will not be redeemed, and the anger pollutes the environment with negative energy. How much better it would be simply to go on our way and do something useful. The Law of Two Feet allows for that by placing the responsibility for our actions directly on our own shoulders. Should we choose to remain in a situation where we are miserable and nonproductive, that is our option. But as our anger and disappointment grows, we need to remember exactly who is keeping us in that uncomfortable situation. We are —and if we want to make a change the means is readily available. Use the two feet!
