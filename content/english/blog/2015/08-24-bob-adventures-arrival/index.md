Bob is a plutonian reporter. He came to Earth because he was bored and had nothing better to do. Bob has a magic microphone that enhances self-awareness for the time it takes to answer his questions. This allows Bob to report the truth, even when itâ€™s hidden under layers of ignorance and self-deception.
