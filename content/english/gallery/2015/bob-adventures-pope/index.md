Now Bob is in Vatican City. The Pope is giving a public speech to his followers and Bob somehow managed to switch the Popeâ€™s microphone with his magic one. Bob is going to destroy religion with his fucked up plutonian science! Religion disappeared from Pluto 56 million years ago, since then plutonians have dealt with their own problems.
